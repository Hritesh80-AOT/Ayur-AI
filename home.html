                        Ayurveda can help with cancer and it can work very well with traditional cancer treatment protocols. It would depend on the type, stage and aggressive nature of the cancer and what your doctor recommends. Before Cancer Treatment – your ayurvedic professional can identify a proper diet, lifestyle, and herbs to retain and gain strength before entering treatment.
                        During cancer treatment – Ayurveda can help to minimize side effects and symptoms from cancer treatments and to keep the digestive fire strong. Herbal juices can be used during chemotherapy and radiation. Herbs and medicated oils can be used in the intervals between treatments to support and enhance the cancer treatment therapies. Meditation, breath exercises and a practice called yoga nidra again provide immense support during this phase.
                        Post Cancer Treatment – Cleanse the body of the toxins after cancer treatment, strongly tonify and build healthy tissues, rebuild and strengthen Immunity. The usage of herbs, foods, body therapies, and yoga practices to prevent another occurrence.

                      Ayurveda treats the root cause of disease and allopathic methods treat symptoms. Ayurveda goes after the root cause which will have a more longstanding effect.
Ayurveda allows you to take the reins of your own health. You don’t have to wait for a prescription or undergo unnecessary tests. For example, if you normally have a pattern of getting a little constipated in fall, then prior to fall you would start eating more warm cooked moderately spiced foods, ingest more healthy oils, take in more water and warm herbal teas, return to a more regular routine, avoid cold & drying foods.

                      Ayurveda can help to minimize side effects and symptoms from cancer treatments and to keep the digestive fire strong. Herbal juices and teas and digestive spices on foods can be used during chemotherapy and radiation. Manjishtha tea decoction and cilantro leaf juice are particularly helpful. Herbs and medicated oils can be used in the intervals between treatments to support and enhance the cancer treatment therapies. Meditation, breath exercises and a practice called yoga nidra again provide immense support during this phase. Ayurveda uniquely offers support in order for the body to let go and allow deep healing to occur.
